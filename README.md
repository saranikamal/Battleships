# Battleships

Here I have shared a non-graphical 2 player battleships game in C++. <br/>
To compile and run the program you will need g++ or any IDE which compiles C++ like VS-Code. </br>
Please pay attention to the comments when entering players' names and directions. </br>
Should you have any questions about the project please feel free to contact me: sarah_nikamalfard@yahoo.com
